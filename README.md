# Not the world's hardest game
A very simple project done while I was learning Unity, a replica of the popular flash game "The World's Hardest Game".\
Later recreated again as a university project, solely using Windows Forms and C# in Visual Studio. [Link here](https://github.com/Alex9633/WorldsHardestGame)
